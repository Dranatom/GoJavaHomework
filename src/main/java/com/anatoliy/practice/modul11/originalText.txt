Happy Independence Day, Malaysia! Or as you may hear in the heart of Kuala Lumpur, “ Merdeka ! Merdeka ! Merdeka !” Sixty years ago these chants ushered in a new era for thousands who descended into a large field to watch Malaysia’s new flag raised.

Hari Merdeka (Merdeka Day) is celebrated with great joy and festivities around the country and ends in a grand parade featuring vibrant floats, military bands, patriotic songs, and unique human graphic displays. Malaysia comes together on Merdeka Day to celebrate the many ethnic groups that call the country home.
